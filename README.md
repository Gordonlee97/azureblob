# Azure Blob Storage: File Download/Upload

This is a prototype for downloading and uploading to Azure Blob storage account as an executable project. File is uploaded to some container inside a unique storage namespace.

*Bug: when uploading a .txt file such as "azureblob.txt", file shows up as ".txt" in the web.
